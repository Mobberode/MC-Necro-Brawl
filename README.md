# Adford / Zombie Survival: Necro Brawl | v1.0
## A more competitive based PvPvE mini-game where the first player / team that reaches the point limit wins the game!

## Either duke it out solo and see how fast you can reach the limit, play against everyone in the race or play in a team competing against other teams to reach the crown.

# // Features //
### Automatic Play meaning everyone can play instead of the old way of someone having to manage the game.
### Configs and Gamemodes
### General Improvements
### Custom Map Support with ZSCreator
